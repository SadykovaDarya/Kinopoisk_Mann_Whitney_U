# Kinopoisk_Mann_Whitney_U
Tested the difference between Kinopoisk top-250 ratings over time using Mann-Whitney U test and Bootstrap. 
Mann-Whitney U test is non-parametric and suitable for small samples, which makes it perfect for our case. And Bootstrap works with almost all sample sizes.
We mostly didn't get statistical difference, except for ratings of USSR movies over time, which make sense, considering political situation.
